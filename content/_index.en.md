An open encyclopedia of Internet censorship

Internet censorship is increasing every day and it is becoming more and more difficult to verify and confirm its existence and origin. Dictatorships and totalitarian regimes try to censor or shut down the Internet more obscurely every day.
Users experience blackouts, but regimes throw the blame abroad and refuse to accept responsibility and guilt. They deprive the people of their freedom and rights, but the people are hesitant to defend their rights because they do not have enough knowledge and evidence.

Therefore, at WikiCensorship, we strive to improve the level of evidence, objections, and confrontation with real perpetrators of Internet censorship and disruption by increasing personal knowledge and transparency.
